# Crawlers
This is a set of crawlers built to analyze the foreclosure market in Miami-Dade and Broward county. <br>

#About
This was my first Python project and it came about due to an investements oportunity presented. It was quite fun to learn Python this way and it truly 
helped the project immensely as the time it took to find all required information dropped to almost zero. Unfortunately, the project fell through about a month into it so work on the crawlers stopped with that.
